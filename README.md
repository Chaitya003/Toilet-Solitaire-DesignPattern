# Toilet-Solitaire-DesignPattern
Toilet Solitaire Game in Java with the Implementation of different design patterns

I have run the file in Intelli J with its IDE run option:

This is the link of the Taiga Kanban board: https://tree.taiga.io/project/chaitya33-ser515-toilet-solitaire-design-pattern/kanban

For running the program in the CommandLine run the Game.java file.
The Game.java file is using different objects to run the logic of the game. It contains all the logic of the rules defined and the player can play the game as much as he/she wants.

For playing the game with GUI run SolitaireGUI.java file.
The SolitaireGUI.java file is using swiing library to implement all the rules and logic of the Solitaire game.
